## Installation

### NPM
```sh
npm install fast-clone --save
```

### Yarn
```sh
yarn add fast-clone
```

## Usage
Fast-clone is a UMD module so you can use it in Node.js, or in Browser either using Browserfy/Webpack, or by using the global clone function if not using a module loader.

### TypeScript
```ts
import clone = require('fast-clone');
```

### JavaScript
```js
const clone = require('fast-clone');
```

```ts
const a = {
	name: 'Natasha Rominov',
	age: 30,
	skills: [
		'Pistols',
		'Espionage'
	],
	dateOfBirth: new Date('1986-05-21T00:00:00.000Z')
};

const b = clone(a);

b.skills.push('That grabby thing she does with her legs');

console.log(a.skills)
console.log(b.skills);
```

Output will be:
```ts
['Pistols', 'Espionage']
['Pistols', 'Espionage', 'That grabby thing she does with her legs']
```
